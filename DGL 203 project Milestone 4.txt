********************************************************************************************

Finally, please write a paragraph about what you've learned this semester including what went well and what didn't.  
At first, it was good to be back on track from the previous course and brush up some of the skills I have and growing gradually on how to build with the new framework and what I need to include in order everything renders and work accordingly


What might you change in this course?  
Perhaps the assignments not to be long, I love the tutorials so I understand at a better pace and I new what I was doing instead of an assignment where am wondering what should I do.

What would you want to keep?  
As as mentioned above the tutorial assignments.

Was the workload appropriate for a college class, or was it above or below that mark? 
For me it was a bit of heavy since I have another 3 courses that consume more than 3 hours per assignment.

What didn't we spend enough time on?  
How to build better skills with sass

Is there anything you feel that was missed? 
More of sass

Finally, do you feel confident and ready to tackle a project on your own now?
I do, I feel very confident.
